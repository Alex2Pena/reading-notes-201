- Objects group together a set of *variables & functions* to create a *model* 
- In an **object** *variables* & *functions* take on  new names.
- **Variables** are known as **properties()**
- **Functions** becime known as **methods(behaiviors)**
-  var  name  =  object.propery/method name

- ***syntax***variable name = {
    property: propert value, 
    property2: 2nd value,

    property4: ['value', 'value', 'value', 'value']
    //methods
    value: function(){
        console.log('string');
    }

}
- console.log(property.value) **dot notation**
- console.log(property.[value]) **bracket notation**
- variable name.value(); **invokes method**
