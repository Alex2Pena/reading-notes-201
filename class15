What google learned about its teams
Taken from INC.com

Dependability. Team members get things done on time and meet expectations.

Structure and clarity. High-performing teams have clear goals, and have well-defined roles within the group.

Meaning. The work has personal significance to each member.

Impact. The group believes their work is purposeful and positively impacts the greater good.

Yes, that's four, not five. The last one stood out from the rest:

Psychological Safety. We've all been in meetings and, due to the fear of seeming incompetent, have held back questions or ideas. I get it. It's unnerving to feel like you're in an environment where everything you do or say is under a microscope.
But imagine a different setting. A situation in which everyone is safe to take risks, voice their opinions, and ask judgment-free questions. A culture where managers provide air cover and create safe zones so employees can let down their guard. That's psychological safety.
