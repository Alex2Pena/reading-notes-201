# Intro to CSS
*imagine that there is an invisible box around each element*

- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements
- CSS rules have 2 parts: **Selector** and **Declaration**.
    **Selector** {
        **Declaration**
    }
- CSS **Declarations** have 2 parts: **Property** and **Value**
    Selector {
        **Property: Value**
    }

1. Internal & External CSS
    - Use `<link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>` to link to an external CSS stylesheet.css
    - Use `<Script>`For internal CSS`</Script>`

2. CSS Selectors
    - `* {} - (Universal selector) targets all elements in doc
    - element name {} - (Type selector) targets specific elements
    - .class name {} (Class selector) targets only elements with specific class
    - `# {} - (ID selector) targets elements with specific id
3. CSS rule priority
    - Always applies last rule read
    - More specific rules such as internal or inline can override last rule
    - Typing: **! important** after a rule will take ultimate priority


#Basic Java Script

- Scripting Language (adds behavior)
- JS can be used inline or on a seperate file
- JS runs where it is found in the HTML
- JS is case sensative

# Methods & objects

document.write('good afternoon!')
- object - document
- member operator - .
- method - write('good afternoon!')
- parameters - 'good afternoon!'

1. Statements
- statements are the individual steps in a Script
- they always start on a new line
- they always end with a semicolon ;
- the semicolon indicates that the step is over
- several statements can exist within a code block

2. Comments
- used to keep internal notes on what the code is doing
- for multi line comments use /* xxxxxx */
- for single line commenmts us //
- you can use it to block specific lines of code for testing purposes

3. Variable
- value to store temporary information
- can be reassigned at anytime
- there is no limit to the number of variables or changes
**var quantity; quantity = 3;**
- var - keyword
- quantity - name
- = - operator
- 3 - value

4. Data Types
- numbers (numeric) 
- '"words/letters" (string)'
- true/false values (boolean)

# Decisions & Loops

1. Comparison Operators
- == - is equal to
- != - is not equal to
- === - strick equal to
- !== - strick not equal to
- `> - greater than
- < - less than
- `>= - greater than or equal to
- <= - less than or equal to

2. Logic Operators
- && - logical and
- || - logical or
- ! - logical not

3. If statements
- if (condition) {
    code to execute if true();
}
- If statements evaluate or check if a condition is true. If so the code is executed

4. If Else staatements
- if (condition) {
    code to execute if true();
}
else {
    code to execute if false();
}
- If Else statements check the condition then execute one code if false or the other if true.
